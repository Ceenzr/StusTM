# Scanning tunneling microscope
## Piezo drivers
Two dual-channel OPA2227 op amps were used to combine signals from DAC in Z+X,Z-X and Z+Y, Z-Y configuration. One decoupling 0.1uF capacitor between each +-15V supply pin and analog ground was added.
## TIA - Transimpedance amplifier
A classic OPA627 TIA configuration with 100M Ohm feedback resistor was used. 5pF capacitor was used to limit osccilations. One decoupling 0.1uF capacitor between each +-15V supply pin and analog ground was added.
